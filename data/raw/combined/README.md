2. **🏷️ Team Names**: Some teams may have slightly different name formats across seasons
3. **📅 Date Format**: All dates have been standardized to YYYY-MM-DD format
4. **📊 Chronological Order**: Data is sorted by Season and Date

## 💻 Usage Examples

```

### 📊 Basic Analysis

```python
# Matches per season
matches_per_season = df.groupby('Season').size()

# Goals scored
df['TotalGoals'] = df['FTHG'] + df['FTAG']

# Home advantage
home_wins = (df['FTR'] == 'H').mean()
```
